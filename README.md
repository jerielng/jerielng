I specialize as a cross-platform mobile developer, fluent in Swift and various other languages and stacks. My passion involves continuously learning new skills in coding and design, and I love helping others do the same.

Check out these developer resources I'm actively working on:
* [Cross-Platform Mobile Development Guide](https://github.com/jerielng/mobile-guide)
* [Personal tech talk presentations](https://github.com/jerielng/presentations)
