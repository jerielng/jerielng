I work daily in Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Java as a cross-platform mobile developer! I love all things code, namely with learning new skills and enabling others to do so. On my profile, you'll find a collection of my personal side projects, which reflect what I've been learning both inside and outside of my day job.

Now that you're here, I'd like to highlight two developer resources I am continuously building. Feel free to check these out!
* [Cross-Platform Mobile Development Guide](https://github.com/jerielng/mobile-guide)
* [Personal tech talk presentations](https://github.com/jerielng/presentations)
