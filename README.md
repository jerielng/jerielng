I work daily in Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Java as a cross-platform mobile developer! I love all things code, namely with learning new skills and enabling others to do so. On my profile, you'll find a collection of my personal side projects, which reflect what I've been learning both inside and outside of my day job.

Feel free to check out these developer resources I am actively building:
* [Cross-Platform Mobile Development Guide](https://github.com/jerielng/mobile-guide)
* [Personal tech talk presentations](https://github.com/jerielng/presentations)
